# Module 1 Final Project


## Introduction

In this document are the project guidelines and specifications for the module 1 final project, and instructions for 
viewing my project results.


## The Deliverables

There were four deliverables for this project, as set forth by the Flatiron instructors:

1. A well documented **Jupyter Notebook** containing any code written for this project and comments explaining it. 
2. A short **Keynote/PowerPoint/Google Slides presentation** (delivered as a PDF export) giving a high-level overview of  methodology and recommendations for non-technical stakeholders.
3. **[A Blog Post](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-welcome-blogging)**	
4. A **Video Walkthrough** of the non-technical presentation. 

## Results
My Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the project is located in this GitHub repository, labeled as student.ipynb.  
The pdf file of my slide presentation is also in this repository, named presentation.pdf.  To view it, simply click on.  I 
used Keynote to create the 9 slides. The video recording is posted on youtube as an unlisted video.  The link for the 
video presentation is: https://youtu.be/y4TO23Px-xw. 


## Presentation Day
I am scheduled to present my finding, technical and non-technical, to my instructor Abhineet Kulkarni on Thursday, August 
29, 2019 at 2:30pm EST.
